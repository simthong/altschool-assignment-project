## Introduction
This code represents a web page layout for a URL shortening service. It includes HTML markup for the page structure and CSS styles to define the visual appearance of the elements.

## HTML Structure
The HTML code is structured as follows:

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration specifies the document type.
- The `<html>` element represents the root of an HTML document.
- The `<head>` section contains metadata and external dependencies such as CSS stylesheets and fonts.
- The `<body>` section contains the main content of the web page.
- The page is divided into different sections, each represented by a `<section>` element.
- Inside the sections, various elements such as `<div>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<img>` are used to structure and display the content.

## CSS Styles
The CSS code defines the visual styles for the HTML elements. It includes styles for the page layout, fonts, colors, and other visual properties. The code uses various CSS selectors to target specific elements and apply the desired styles.

## Usage

1. Create an HTML file and open it in a web browser.
2. Copy the HTML code into the file, replacing any existing content.
3. Save the file with an `.html` extension.
4. Create a CSS file and link it to the HTML file using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.
